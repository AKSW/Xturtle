# Xturtle

Xturtle is a turtle editor solution based on eclipse / Xtext2. It features syntax highlighting, code completion (resource qnames, datatypes, language tags, literals, prefixes and namespace URIs from prefix.cc), templates, syntax validation, internal linking to descriptions, preview of resources, navigation, outline and quick outline, folding (prefixes, subject blocks, multiline literals) and multiple customization options including syntax highlighting.

This screenshot shows an example Xturtle workspace with an open turtle file from a project which imports several other projects (including the core project). The image demonstrates some error, warning and info messages, the resource preview via description attributes, the outline as well as folding capabilities.
