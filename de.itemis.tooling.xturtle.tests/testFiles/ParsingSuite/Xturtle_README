Files in this folder are copies of the Turtle TestSuite (see LICENSE and README).
Here they are only used for evaluation of the syntax, not IRI resolution!
They are split into two main groups
* Test cases correctly handled by Xturtle (passing)
* Test cases not correctly handled by Xturtle (passing)

Each group is furter devided into
* files with correct syntax (positive)
* files with syntax errors (negative)

Going through the failing tests, 
you can evaluate if the incorrect handling by Xturtle is a problem for you (file an issue).

For failing test cases *a comment* may have been appended indicating why we think
that failing in this case is not problematic.
